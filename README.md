# An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
perfoming analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends and potential insights for launching a successful kickstarter

For the purpose of this analysis 4109 different types of kickstarters will be used with the subsequent data. The types of data that will be used with vary from date launched, date finished, number of backers, goal amount, pledged amount, country of origin, and whether or not the campaign was successful. The aforementioned types of data will being used in Excel to further extrapoate and return new information.

To better focus the anaylsis covered, it will cover the theater/plays category.

With success rate in mind the month of May showed a greatest amount of successful launches for Theater based campaigns. The months prior for the most part had similar success rates, however all the months following May shows a decline of success. April most notably has the most failed campaigns for theater.

Also in terms of success the theater category outperfomed the rest of the other categories.

Looking more specifically at US plays in the theater category one can see the average goal for successful plays is at 5k. The average goal for failed US plays is at 10k.
## please see discriptive stats in the workbook for more.

Upon viewing all of the data newly compiled from the workbook, I can say that the lower the goal for a play the more likely that it will succeed if launched in the month of May.
